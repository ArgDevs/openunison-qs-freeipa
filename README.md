# OpenUnison FreeIPA Quickstart

This quickstart will deploy an OpenUnison integration with FreeIPA.  Once deployed,
a user will be able to:
1. Register
2. Request access to groups managed by FreeIPA
3. Update their own profile and upload an SSH key
4. Use a self service password reset if they forget their password

In addition to the keystore created in the instructions from https://hub.docker.com/r/tremolosecurity/openunisons2idocker/ the FreeIPA root certificate
should be added to the keystore.
