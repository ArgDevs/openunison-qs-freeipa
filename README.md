# OpenUnison FreeIPA Quickstart

This quickstart will deploy an OpenUnison integration with FreeIPA.  Once deployed,
a user will be able to:

1. Register
2. Request access to groups managed by FreeIPA
3. Update their own profile and upload an SSH key
4. Use a self service password reset if they forget their password

In addition to the keystore created in the instructions from https://hub.docker.com/r/tremolosecurity/openunisons2idocker/ the FreeIPA root certificate
should be added to the keystore.

## Use

Once deployed, access this site by navigating to https://OU_HOST/ replacing
OU_HOST with the value of the OU_HOST environment variable.  For instance, if
OU_HOST is myapp.mycompany.lan use https://myapp.mycompany.lan/.  Once prompted
for a username and password, use a uid and password from FreeIPA.  Once logged in, a page showing all headers,
request and session variables is shown.

## Production Deployment

Once you've moved past a proof of concept and wish to move into production there are some areas that should be updated:

1.  Fork the TS repo - Create a fork of this repo so you can make customizations
2.  ScaleJS pages - This repo proxies the pages directly our of their github repo.  This is great for a quick POC, but for a production deployment you should copy down the ScaleJS pages so you can make edits, update the logos, etc.
3.  Tweak the tuning parameters - All of the connection pools have parameters for the number of connections, timeouts, etc.
4.  Remove components you don't need - If you don't need user self registration, just password reset and ScaleJS go ahead and remove it.
5.  Create a database for the scheduler - See the OpenUnison documentation for specifics but you don't want scheduled tasks to be run on every OpenUnison instance, only one.
6.  Connect to a JMS Server - Just as with the scheduler, connecting to an external JMS scheduler will provide scalability and high availability across a cluster.
7.  Create separate static keys for workflows, queues, etc - The unison-session key is used throughout the configuration for simplicity.  Once you are ready for production separate keys should be used for different functions to decrease the impact of a change or if one of the keys is compromised.
